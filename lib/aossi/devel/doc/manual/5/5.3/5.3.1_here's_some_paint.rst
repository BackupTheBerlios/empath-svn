Being able to define custom signals allows some modicum of flexibility, but
the syntax to create a signal and properly connect callables to slots can
be a bit tedious. There is also the issue where a slot in a specific slot
category can cater to different up-front functionality though ultimately
the low-level implementation remains the same.

The decorator syntax can be used to ease the above two issues: most of the
tiresome grunt-work involved in creating/using a signal can be hidden
within a decorator, and different decorators can be used to modify slot
callables before they get connected to a slot.

The following chapters walk through the implementation of various
decorators that are defined in the ``aossi.decorators`` module while
offering examples of both the specific usage of each decorator and how to
create custom decorators.
