The ``aossi.signals`` module provides the following two classes that serve
to combine all the previous extensions into one signal:

>>> from aossi.core import BaseSignal
>>> from aossi.signals import (OnReturnExtension, StreamExtension, ChooseExtension, ReplaceExtension, AroundExtension)
>>> class DefaultExtension(OnReturnExtension, StreamExtension, ChooseExtension, ReplaceExtension, AroundExtension):
...    __slots__ = ()
...
>>> class Signal(DefaultExtension, BaseSignal):
...    __slots__ = ()
...
