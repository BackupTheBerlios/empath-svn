4.2.1 Cake and Pie
====================

Being able to define signals and connect callables to slots that run before
or after the signal runs is useful if not exactly flexible. Wouldn't it be
nice if there was some way to extend the functionality of ``BaseSignal``?

This is where the ``aossi.signals`` module comes in. It defines the base
``SignalExtension`` class from which all other signal extensions derives as
well as a handful of interesting extensions. It wraps up all these
extensions into a single ``Signal`` class which is a subclass of
``BaseSignal``. The rest of this chapter will implement each of the
extensions found in the ``aossi.signals`` module to illustrate and provide
the necessary knowledge required to create signal extensions.
