4.2.1.1 Core Concepts
========================

To understand the following implementations, it is necessary to understand
the core concepts at the heart of the ``BaseSignal`` class.

Every signal can have four basic categories of slots which each run at
different times during the invocation of a signal: before, replace, around,
after.

Before
--------
This slot category is reserved for slots that run entirely before the
signal is called. An example of a slot in this category is the ``before``
slot that is built into the ``BaseSignal`` class. Arguments cannot be
modified, and the return value of any callables of these slots is ignored.

Replace
--------
This slot category is reserved for slots that completely replaces the
underlying callable a signal is based upon.

Around
-------
This slot category is for slots that control the arguments being passed
into a signal and the output being returned from a signal. An example of a
slot in this category is the AroundExtension class implemented below.

After
------
This slot category is for slots that run completely after the signal has
been invoked. Slots in this category cannot modify the return value, and
anything returned by the callables of these slots is ignored.
