======
AOSSI
======

AOSSI is a pure python signal/slot implementation. It draws inspiration 
from signal-slots in QT [1]_, the AOP support from the Dojo toolkit [2]_, 
the RuleDispatch package from PEAK [3]_, and a python cookbook recipe [4]_  
as well as a C++ library [5]_.

Dependencies
=============

Python Interpreter
-------------------
AOSSI currently requires version 2.5 of the python interpreter. However,
as there are no parts that require anything specific to python2.5, a future
version of this package will most likely be refactored to support python2.4
as well.

External Packages
------------------
AOSSI depends on two external packages:

* smanstal
* anyall

Installation
=============
